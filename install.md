## Install

Install Python 3.x first. Then install the reqs with this command
 - Linux: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (make sure that you're in the directory with screamingbot)
Windows is the same but it's `python` instead of `python3` - only `python` refers to ew python 2.7 in linux


Then make a .env file in this format:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=yourdiscordbottoken
```

You should be good to go after that.
